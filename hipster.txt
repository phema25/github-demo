Your punishment must be more severe.

When a forest grows too wild, a pruging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatedt city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

We have purged your fear. You are ready to lead these men. You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows. But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.

Speak of the devil, and he shall appear.

Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

I am the League of shadows.

My anger outweighs my guilt.

You are in hell, littleman. And I am the devil.

Do you feel incharge?
